An AI Racing System that connects to any creation!
[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Have you ever wanted to race against your own creations but have no one to race with?
Now you can! With this racing system, you can make any creation race around any specially designed track!
With a relatively simple setup and no extra downloads needed, you can now race against as many ai cars as you want!

[b]WARNING:[/b] This is a Beta: things might go wrong and may cause your game to lag or cars to malfunction. Please report all bugs and issues. This mod is also constantly updating, check out the change notes to see added features and fixes!
